# Project Trivia React Redux
Trivia is quiz game on a web application based on an API.
It was part of my Web Development course at Trybe and the goal was to practice React with Redux, creating a store, reducers, actions, dispatchers, conecting Redux with React components and async actions. Also to practice testing with React Testing Library.
It was developed in a group of students.
